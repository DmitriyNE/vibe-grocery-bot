# Vibe Grocery Bot

**WARNING: THIS ENTIRE PROJECT WAS VIBECODED WITH ONLY HOMEOPATHIC HUMAN EDITS!**

This is a small Telegram bot for keeping a collaborative grocery list. The code came into being through vibes and automated tooling rather than meticulous engineering, so expect quirks.

## Development

You'll need a recent Rust toolchain with `sqlx` and `teloxide` dependencies. The CI configuration uses `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy` and `cargo test` so running them locally is a good idea too.

Have fun and vibe responsibly!
